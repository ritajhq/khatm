Published on an ephemeral host port rather than reusing this number as the host port, for the same reason `container-orchestrated`'s own `portMappings` does: the host's port space is global across every local stack, so pinning 3900 there makes this deployment the thing that collides (with a second bucket, or with any other project on the machine that happens to publish 3900) instead of leaving Docker to pick a free port. `docker compose port <service> ${S3_API_PORT}` finds it. */

 * the official image is `scratch`, so there is no shell in which an entrypoint
 * script could drive it. That CLI work is declared as an `initCommand`
 * instead, for the core to run from the host once the apply has brought the
 * container up (`garageSeedScript`). `class: critical` gets a persistent named
 * volume for `/var/lib/garage`, same convention `relational`'s own provisioner
 * already uses for its data volume — anything less than critical is ephemeral,
 * losing the bucket's layout/keys/objects on every restart (acceptable for a
 * "spin it up for now" instance, not for one meant to keep data; the seed
 * command simply re-seeds the fresh container).
